# BrightCare Clinic

BrightCare Clinic is a web-based clinic management system built as part of the IT329 project.  
It helps **patients** book and manage appointments, and allows **doctors** to view, confirm, and prescribe medications.  

- **Phase 1**: Frontend prototype (HTML, CSS, JS).  
- **Phase 2**: Backend with PHP + MySQL (login, signup, appointments, prescriptions).  
- **Phase 3**: AJAX integration (dynamic confirm/cancel appointments, filter doctors).  

This repository contains the source code, database schema, and project structure.
